# The AI Tutor Trap: Pick the Study Platform That Won’t Replace You

> **If you don’t control the tools, the tools will control you.**

![Cognitive Dependency Spiral](/images/cognitive-dependency-spiral.png)

## TL;DR
- AI study tools feel helpful but can quietly **reduce** your ability to think alone.
- Pick a tool for the **skill you need**, not the brand you like.
- Use a **stack**: one tool to build reasoning, one to spar, one for steps.
- Run the **14‑day test** below. Keep what makes you better **without** the tool.

---

## Why this matters
AI tutors answer fast. That speed can hide a problem: your brain stops doing the hard work. When the tool is gone, you stall. This post shows how to avoid that.

---

## The dependency spiral
1) Curiosity → 2) Quick answers → 3) Trust without checks → 4) Copy/paste → 5) Skill loss → 6) Replacement.

> The smoother the lesson, the weaker the learner.

## Quick platform picks (by goal)

| Goal | Best fit | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Build reasoning depth** | **Claude (Extended Thinking)** | Pushes you to explain steps and defend choices. |
| **Turn ideas into drafts fast** | **ChatGPT (Study Mode)** | Great as a sparring partner and editor. |
| **Work through code or math** | **Gemini (Guided Learning / LearnLM)** | Clear step‑by‑step logic and debugging. |
| **Teach foundations (K‑12)** | **Khanmigo** | Safe, mastery‑based practice. |
| **Get quick homework help** | **QANDA** | Fast walkthroughs and solutions. |
| **Casual learning** | **Grok** | Light summaries; not for deep skill. |

> Rule of thumb: if it feels too easy for too long, switch tools.

## Build your learning stack
Use the right tool for the right mental muscle.

![Cognitive Survival Stack](/images/cognitive-survival-stack.png)

- **Suffering Engine** → **Claude** for hard reasoning.
- **Sparring Partner** → **ChatGPT** for idea fights and polish.
- **Specialist** → **Gemini** for stepwise code/math.
- **Trainer Mode** → **Khanmigo** for basics and practice.
- **Utility Layer** → **QANDA** for quick lookups only.

Keep the stack small. Depth first. Add tools later.

---

## The 14‑day test (keep what works)
- **Days 1–3: Learn.** Study one topic with your chosen tool.
- **Day 4: Go dark.** Explain it **without** any AI.
- **Days 5–7: Switch.** Learn the same topic with a second tool. Compare.
- **Day 10: Invert.** You write the answer; the AI only **critiques**.
- **Day 14: Decide.** Which tool left you stronger **without it**? Keep that.

> If you can’t perform without the tool, the tool is training you for replacement.

---

## Final check
Ask yourself:
1) Can I do this work **solo**?  
2) Do I know **why** each step is right?  
3) Did this tool make me **less** dependent after two weeks?

If the answer is “no,” change tools or change your stack.
